# ercreager.github.io

This is a repository containing all of the source code for my personal website. You can view the live site at <http://ercreager.github.io>. The website is designed as an overview page until I set up a more robust personal website. The website is powered by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). Jekyll is a static, blog-aware website generator, so the files in this repo are primarily HTML, CSS, and Markdown.
