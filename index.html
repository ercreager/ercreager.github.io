	<h2>Iâ€™m a physicist and Senior Data Scientist with 7+ years of experience in the field.</h2>
	<p>During my 5+ years at <a href="https://bluetriangle.com/" target="_blank">Blue Triangle</a>, I honed my skills in <b>Python</b> programming, SQL querying, data manipulation, web scraping, and crafting insightful visualizations from unstructured data. I specialized in test case development with Selenium and customizing <b>data collection</b> through lightweight JavaScript code compatible with modern browsers. I found satisfaction in <b>automating</b> scheduled reports, optimizing data sets for analysis, as well as making data both accessible and actionable.</p>
	<p>In my role as an Implementation Manager at <a href="https://solium.com/" target="_blank">Solium Capital</a>, I managed end-to-end projects involving the migration of clients onto a new software platform via ETL processes. This position demanded proficiency in developing and maintaining <b>SQL</b> scripts for individual databases, simultaneously managing multiple client projects, meticulous <b>data analysis</b>, comprehensive project documentation, as well as the provision of technical support and training to clients.</p>
	<p>Before venturing into the private sector, I worked in the <a href="https://ams.arizona.edu/" target="_blank">Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Laboratory</a> at the University of Arizona, where I played a crucial role in improving <b>radioisotope</b> dating equipment. I also had the privilege of developing and hosting a <b>particle physics masterclass</b> for local high school students. My educational background includes a B.S. in <b><a href="https://w3.physics.arizona.edu/" target="_blank">Physics</a></b>, providing a solid foundation for my data-driven career.</p>
	<p>My career journey has consistently showcased my analytical prowess, meticulous attention to detail, and my ability to swiftly adapt to emerging technologies and methodologies in the Data Science field.</p>
	<p>When I'm not writing code, you can probably find me rock climbing, playing games, or working on my latest DIY project. I'm always on the lookout for new opportunities, volunteer talks, side projects, or just to grab lunch with someone interesting.
