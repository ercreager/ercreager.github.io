	<p>I am a physicist and software developer. I recently relocated to Richmond, Virginia. I am passionate about learning.</p>
	<p>I graduated from the University of Arizona with a B.S. in Physics in 2016. I chose physics because it offered a unique opportunity to learn more about the world by solving problems. I am now solving software development problems (a.k.a. fixing bugs) for the Mozilla Foundation while looking for my next full-time position.</p>
	<p>When I'm not writing code, you can probably find me camping, running, playing frisbee, reading, playing music, or working on my latest D.I.Y. project.</p>
