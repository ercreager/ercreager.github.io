	<h1 id="welcome-header">Hi! I'm Emily Creager.</h1>
		<img src="/assets/Fountain.png" alt="Photo of Emily Creager" id="FountainPhoto" >
	<p>I am a physicist and software developer. I recently relocated to Richmond, Virginia and I love to learn. I am currently working at Blue Triangle Technologies, a SaaS platform offering digital experience optimization, as a Data Scientist.</p>
	<p>I graduated from the University of Arizona with a B.S. in Physics. I chose physics because it offered a unique opportunity to learn more about the world by solving problems.</p>
	<p>When I'm not writing code, you can probably find me rock climbing, camping, running, playing frisbee, reading, playing music, or working on my latest D.I.Y. project.</p>
