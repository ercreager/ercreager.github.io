	<h1>About</h1>
		<p><q>I can make this better,</q> I realized. While attending an outreach event, I recognized a few simple modifications that would improve the quality of the event.</p>
		<p>Three years later, I set up a similar outreach event that included all of the modifications from my time as an attendee. Now, I pride myself on possessing a blend of technical knowledge and interpersonal skills.</p>
		<p>My volunteer outreach work has further developed my interpersonal and public speaking skills by explaining science concepts to students with varying levels of science knowledge. These strengths factored into my promotion to Vice President of Women in Science and Engineering (WISE). During my time as Vice President, I guided a team through planning and running events that promoted STEM fields to 5,000+ students annually.</p>
		<p>I also gained a familiarity and comfort with analyzing and solving difficult problems from completing a B.S. in Physics. During my studies, the C programming language was introduced as a tool for solving physics problems computationally. I found that I enjoy solving problems with programming, and I have decided to use this technical background to pursue a career in software development.</p>
		<p>I applied my knowledge of programming from physics at Solium Capital, a software-as-a-service finance company, by developing, analyzing, and adapting SQL scripts to extract data from various client databases. After completing several online software development courses, I am now expanding my programming skills by contributing to Mozilla Firefox source code. My primary contributions so far have been fixing bugs using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</p>
		<p>I am currently seeking full-time employment and volunteering for the Mozilla Foundation. In my next position, I hope to continue my process of lifelong learning and self-improvement through solving problems.</p>
		<p>I welcome new professional connections. Please, feel free to contact me at emilyrcreager@gmail.com or (520) 314 - 6680.</p>
